                5. Your rights in relation to your ‘Personal Information’
            </h3> 

              <p>
              ARTICULUS Centro believes that it is imperative that all ARTICULUS Centro users have control over their Personal Information. Therefore, depending on the way you use the ARTICULUS Centro Services, you may have the right to request access to, receive a copy of, update, amend or delete, port certain Personal Information to another service, restrict, or object to certain uses of your Personal Information. Further, when we rely on your consent for processing of your Personal Information you can withdraw your consent at any time, and such withdrawal will take effect from thereon.
              <br></br><br></br>
              If you are a ARTICULUS Centro user, you can access and correct a lot of your Personal Information directly through your account, or via online forms ARTICULUS Centro makes available to you (as detailed below). You can also exercise your rights by sending your request to reaching out to our customer care department. When we receive your right request, we may take steps to verify your identity before complying with the request to protect your privacy and security.
              <br></br><br></br>
              Before fulfilling your request, we may ask you for additional information in order to confirm your identity and for security purposes. We reserve the right to charge a fee where permitted by law (e.g. if your request is unfounded or excessive).
              <br></br><br></br>
              Please note that permanently deleting your ARTICULUS Centro account erases all of your Personal Information from ARTICULUS Centro's databases. After completing this process, you can no longer use any of your ARTICULUS Centro Services, your account and all its data will be removed permanently, and ARTICULUS Centro will not be able to restore your account or retrieve your data in the future. If you contact our support channels in the future, the system will not recognize your account and support agents will not be able to locate the deleted account.
              <br></br><br></br>
             You may also correct and/or update your Personal Information through your user account, if you have one.
             <br></br><br></br>
             You can also delete your Personal Information by deleting  your entire account. We will respond to your requests within a reasonable timeframe.
